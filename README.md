# Overview
This is a very *basic template* to install a PWA.<br>
Included is also a working example of a *push notification* that you can host on
and test on a local environment.

# Requirements
For development you need to to Host the site on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
You can not use other IPs or domain names because localhost will have special
permissions<br>
You can host the files locally with Live Server (Plugin for Visual Studio code), apache, nginx or any other http server

Opening  file with `file://` will not work.

For a real Domain/production you need a valid TLS certificate
(host the site with `https://`)
